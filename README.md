# World_Weather_Analysis

This analysis was performed for the client, PlanMyTrip. The code created is meant to allow the app help users search for nearby cities based on their weather criteria and filtered cities find hotels that are nearby. Using google APIs, the code is also able to allow the users plan travels to neighboring cities and show hotels available in those cities.
